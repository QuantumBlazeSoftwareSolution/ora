# Ora - Project Ideas & Concepts

## Core Philosophy

- **Customer First**: The main entry point (`/`) is a **Marketplace** for shoppers to discover local businesses, not a SaaS sales page.
- **Vibe Check**: The design must be "Vibrant", "Friendly", and "Premium". avoid the "Bureaucratic/Corporate" feel of traditional business registration sites.
- **Target Audience**: Creative MSMEs (Gift shops, Salons, Artists, Home Bakers).

## Key Features

- **WhatsApp Checkout**: The primary commerce engine. Minimal friction for buyers.
- **Link-in-Bio**: The store serves as a professional portfolio/storefront.
- **10-Minute Onboarding**: "Go online in 10 minutes."

## Administrative Flows

- **Staged Registration**: Business signup is not instant. It follows a wizard flow:
  1.  **Personal Info**: User account creation.
  2.  **Business Info**: Store details.
  3.  **Verification**: Document upload (NIC/BR).
- **Admin Approval**: A "Human in the loop" approval system. New stores start as `pending` and must be manually approved by an admin before going live.
